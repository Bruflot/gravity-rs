Raw Rust bindings for the [Gravity API](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity). Lets you embed a Gravity VM in Rust applications and execute Gravity code.

A safe, idiomatic wrapper is under development and can be found in the `wrapper` branch.

## Examples

- The `addition` example embeds a Gravity VM and runs a simple arithmetic function written in Gravity.
- More to come.
