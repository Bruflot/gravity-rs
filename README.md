# gravity-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bruflot/gravity-rs.svg?branch=wrapper)](https://travis-ci.org/Bruflot/gravity-rs)

Safe, idiomatic Rust bindings for [Gravity](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity). Lets you
embed and execute Gravity code in Rust applications.

The project is currently in very early stages and far from done. It's prone to change drastically 
in the future with no regard to backwards compatibility. Contributions are more than welcome - feel
free to open an issue or send a pull request.

**Note:** For linking the library, you can either use the `GRAVITY_LIB_DIR` environment variable,
or make sure the library is found by your system's dynamic linker.

## Examples

- The `addition` example compiles and runs a simple arithmetic script written in Gravity from
within Rust.
- More to come.
