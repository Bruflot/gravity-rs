# gravity-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bruflot/gravity-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Bruflot/gravity-rs)

Raw Rust bindings for the [Gravity API](https://github.com/marcobambini/gravity). Lets you embed a Gravity VM in Rust applications and execute Gravity code.

A safe, idiomatic wrapper is under development and will be published soon.

## Examples

- The `addition.rs` example embeds a Gravity VM in a Rust application and runs a simple arithmetic function written in Gravity.
- More to come.
